# love_search_template_bank

Jupyter notebooks illustrating the construction of the template bank used in [arxiv:2306.00050](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.00050.pdf): "In Pursuit of Love: First Templated Search for Compact Objects with Large Tidal Deformabilities in the LIGO-Virgo Data". The construction of this template bank is the first part of the matched-filtering data pipeline that aimed to search for new gravitational wave signals emitted by compact objects with large "Love numbers" in the public O1, O2, O3a and O3b LIGO-Virgo data.
